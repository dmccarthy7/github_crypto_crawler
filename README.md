The purpose of this tool is to identify and score Github profiles on the basis of their crypto-native engineering work.  It uses the Github API to crawl profiles and searches for keywords and repos that suggest core crypto engineering expertise, assigns a score to the profile based on those factors, and outputs a stack rank of the top profiles.

It's possible this could be expanded into a more generic (or more specific) sourcing tool that's capable of identifying GitHub profiles that suggest expertise in other engineering domains.
